# Bash Decrypter
Decrypter for https://github.com/KasRoudra/k-fuscator

When I wrote the `decode.fish`, I didn't know which encrypter was used so I wrote it manually; seems like the encoder itself has decoding features as well.


Usage:
```fish
./decode.fish init    # initial decode
./decode.fish base64  # decode the rest of them
```
